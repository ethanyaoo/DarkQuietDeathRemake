was going
-barely had time to get a grasp at where he was before flashlight turned off
-lengthen the battery decreases
-decrease flashlight radius as battery goes down
-radius goes down if battery is 0

-sprites seemed like the right size
-feels more like a turn-based game
-grid makes it feel like you should be navigating something or fighting something like a tactics game
-game ends when you do see the enemy

-turn off anti alias because text becomes a bit blurry in comparison with sprites
-if you want to replace black space just put something for aesthetics with a meaning
-instead of pressing the flashlight to turn it on, hold it down to keep it on
-confused if there is something that you should be doing

-need eiry music
-with every key instead of refilling the battery the battery permanently recharges faster?
-confused about story? narrative?

-battery is a bit too fast for being used up

MY NOTES:
-Flashlight icon UI with a letter F that highlights when you press F
